//! rtc-dfloat-v1: lossless bf16 codec.
//!
//! bf16 = [sign:1][exponent:8][mantissa:7]. The exponent has low entropy for LLM
//! weights, so we entropy-code it (canonical Huffman) and store sign+mantissa raw.
//! Original implementation (technique from DFloat11, arXiv 2504.11651); no code
//! was copied and no external dependency is used.

/// Split a bf16 bit pattern into (exponent, residual=sign|mantissa).
/// exponent = bits 14..=7 ; residual = (sign << 7) | mantissa(bits 6..=0).
